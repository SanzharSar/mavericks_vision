Since the beginning of the season, we have been working on creating a fully autonomous method for detecting the team prop, using OpenCV to identify shapes and correctly map them to a 2D array of positions. We used an algorithm to detect and count pixels of a specific color and the number of contours to determine where the team prop is located. This algorithm has proven to be highly adaptable to various factors, such as changes in lighting.
